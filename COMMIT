A day's work

Here is all the changes off the top of my head:

 - Lots of atomics have been changed from the default ceq_con to either 
acquire, release or relaxed (depending on which is necessary)

 - We shouldn't do jobs bug has been fixed by simply waiting till we can
do it. It's a timing bug which I stopped being able to reproduce after the next 
fix, now it's been fixed by simply waiting for it to be ready. 

 - ConditionalContinue had a bug where signal could be incremented after
the check in wait but notify_all could be called before the other thread
reached wait. Moving the mutex back to also protect the signal check
fixes this.
