Oren-lang is a simple language which is run by the Oren-VM. The Oren-VM has a
8mib stack, a instruction pointer and, of course, your program!

Your program will be composed of a string of omg, why and wtf. All other words
will be ignored. New lines will be ignored.

Omg and why will represent 0 and 1, respectively, meanwhile, wtf will be a token
separator.

Every round, Oren-VM will execute the operation pointed at by the IP if it is a
valid operation, else it will halt.

Here are the Instructions:

PUSH [VAL] - Pushes the value [VAL] onto the stack then increments IP by one.

POP - Pops the last value (VAL1) off the stack then increments IP by one.

NAND - Pops the last value (VAL1) and the value before it (VAL2) off the stack,
pushes back (VAL1) NAND (VAL2) then increments IP by one.

DUPE [COUNT] - Copies then pushes the last [COUNT] values onto the stack then
increments IP by one.

OUT - Pops the last value off the stack (VAL1) then prints it to stdout then
increments IP by one.

IN - Pushes a value from stdin onto the stack then increments IP by one.

JUMP - Pops the last value (VAL1) off the stack then sets IP to (VAL1)

Conversion Table: 
PUSH | 001
POP  | 010
NAND | 011
DUPE | 100
OUT  | 101
IN   | 110
JUMP | 111
